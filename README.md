## Install library for movement and heating functions

To get started with the movement and heating functions, you need to download and install the library for the motor driver, [click here to download](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_TB6612FNG_Arduino_Library/archive/master.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the folder. Then you will need to find where your Arduino IDE foler is located, and move the unzipped folder to **Arduino** -> **Libraries**, for example, my Arduino folder is located here:
